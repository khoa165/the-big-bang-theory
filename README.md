# The Big Bang Theory info
#### Built with Ruby.
I am a big fan of The Big Bang Theory series. I was really sad that the series just ended in May (2019). Since I just studied parsing recently, I thought it may be nice to look for interesting json file and play around with it. I stumbled upon the json file of the big bang theory episodes and I decided to parse and extract the summary for each episode. The information seems very nice, except it misses several episodes of the latest season (season 12), probably due to copyright or something.
